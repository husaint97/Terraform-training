* Let's try to put togather things what we have learnt so far.

| step 1                | 
| --------------------- |
| Terraform intallation |

| step 2                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------- |
| * written simple config file to create EC2 instance |

| step 3                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| * understood about state file                                     |
| * written simple config file to create EC2 instance               |
| * modified tag name and did apply to check how state file behaves |

| step 4                                                                         |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| * understood about variable                                                    |
| * splitted config files as per plugin for easy debug & understanding           |
| * declared variables in `variable.tf` file and call the variable when required |
| * example to understand how to provide variables as command line i/p           |
| * example to understand how to provide variables from `tfvars` file            |

| step 5                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| * understood how to pass credentials in secure way using aws-cli                 | 
| * aws-cli installation                                                           |
| * created env file using aws-cli which has aws credentials                       |
| * created config file which can create EC2 instances                             |
| * credentials are not hardcoded instead making terraform to get it from env file |
